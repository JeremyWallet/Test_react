Create a search input text where users can type and get results immediately. 
The results will list Github users like the template below, and should be responsive.

## The subject
Request against the Github Api: GET https://api.github.com/search/users?q={USER}.
Don't forget to check for modern ways to make HTTP requests on the frontend.
Handling edge cases:
No results

## Bonus
